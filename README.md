I am a self-motivated software developer and a quick learner. I have been an experienced software developer for over 6 years and have built many production-grade desktop, web, and database applications. 

I've mastered standard software development techniques like unit tests, mock tests, agile, data structures, asynchronous programming, object-oriented programming, object-relational mapping, design patterns, and coding best practices. My development workflow has been refined over the years, and I can build high-quality applications at a fast pace.

Building amazing interactive stuff is my passion and I'm happiest when I'm getting my hands dirty with the code. Commitment and eagerness are the skills that allow me to implement the best solutions and satisfy the customerâ€™s needs.
